            <h3>The Mission</h3>
            <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any monkey had 
                ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles(500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in the South Atlantic,
                1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>We all head the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a 
                    man's work... what they're trying to do is send a man up to do a monkey's work.</q>

            <h4>The Jupiter AM-13 and The Journey</h4>
            <p>
                The Jupiter IRBM(Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was originally developed by the US Army as long-range successor to its PGM-11 Redstone missile,
                but was eventually taken over and developed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the only one of the United
                States' early strategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.
            </p>
           
            <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a monkey abot one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with intruments, including temperture
                meters and microphones which recorded his historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding acheivements of space research.
